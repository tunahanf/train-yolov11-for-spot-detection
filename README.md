<h2>üßê Rundown</h2>

*   This project involves training a custom <strong>YOLOv11</strong> model to detect <strong>bird droppings on cars</strong>.
*   Initially, the model was intended to detect <strong>paint defects on car surfaces</strong>, but due to dataset limitations, it was adapted to bird dropping detection.
*   The trained model serves as a <strong>preparatory study</strong> for detecting macro defects on car parts in the future.
*   The dataset used for training was curated and annotated specifically for this task.

   
<h2>üíª Built with</h2>

*   <strong>Ultralytics</strong> - Used for implementing and training the YOLOv11 model.


<h2>üìä Results & Evaluation</h2>

*   <strong>Confusion Matrix</strong> - Visual representation of classification performance.

While initially intended for macro defect detection in automotive production, this project demonstrates the potential of a custom-trained YOLOv11 model. The results show promise, and future iterations will build on this foundation to achieve the original goal of macro defect detection on automotive parts.
